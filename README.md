# AXUSB HOST
A Async USB Host Driver Framework, Includes:
- **Driver interface** to let you write your own host device drivers
- Async io
- Compatible to other usb stacks (i.e: cotton, even linux(maybe, compatible to accept URB?))
- Several packed drivers
- Controller driver
- A Framework to combine all these features above

## Todo & Doing
- [ ] migrating codebase from [arceos_experiment](https://github.com/arceos-usb/arceos_experiment.git)
- [ ] reconstruct code to introduce async io
